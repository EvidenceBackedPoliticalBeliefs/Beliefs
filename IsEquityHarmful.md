# Is Equity Harmful to Society?
Equity is a term often conflated with equality, but importantly distinct. Equity has been interpreted to mean equality of outcomes over equality of opportunities. This is a somewhat reasonable sounding premise, but the core concept, and implementation leads much to be desired. As I hope to show in this article.

As always please read the [Bias Busting](https://evidencebasedpolitics.org/FlawedThinking/BiasBusting.html) guide if you have not already done so.

# Definitions
It will be beneficial to explicitly define what I am referring to in the arguments.

## Harm
<a href="Argumentation.md#-implicit-assumptions" class="tag tag-implicit"></a>

Harm is defined according to the [framework](https://evidencebasedpolitics.org/README.html) (harm based consequentialism).

## Merit

<a href="Argumentation.md#-descriptive" class="tag tag-descriptive"></a>

An individual's total value to society in the form of their skills, achievements, effort, labour. 

No characteristic of their involuntary identity is considered in merit (e.g. race, sex, etc). 

No knowledge of their personal history is required beyond their past achievements and labours (no disabilities, no past discrimination etc).

## Equality

<a href="Argumentation.md#-descriptive" class="tag tag-descriptive"></a>

For this argument I will take this general definition of equality taken from [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/equality-human-rights)

> Generally, an ideal of uniformity in treatment or status by those in a position to affect either.

The end goal of equality would be equal opportunity for all. Essentially no biases to involuntary or immutable states would affect someone's life. That may include Race, Sex, Sexuality, Appearance, Height, Weight, Age.

Essentially allowing a person's merit and ability be the sole determinant of their success.

Defined as a function `Deserved success = Merit`.

## Equity

<a href="Argumentation.md#-descriptive" class="tag tag-descriptive"></a>

I will define equity by the top definition returned by [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=equity) (Oxford Languages)

> The quality of being fair and just, especially in a way that takes account of and seeks to address existing inequalities.

Equity is the pursuit of balancing outcomes by taking into consideration a person's personal circumstances and history and adjusting outcomes accordingly.

Defined as a function `Deserved success = Merit + Disadvantages cost`

## Equality vs Equity

<a href="Argumentation.md#-descriptive" class="tag tag-descriptive"></a>

The difference between equity and equality is often presented with the simplistic example of a ladder. 

- There are 3 people
- Two of the people are of an average height
- One is 50% shorter than average due to a genetic defect.

| Height | Equality | Equity |
|-|-|-|
| 🧍Average| 🪜 | 🪜|
| 🧍🏽Average | 🪜 | 🪜|
| 🧍 Short | 🪜| 🪜🪜|

Equality states that everyone is treated fairly and equally by being issued the same ladder.

Equity states that the outcome is unfair because the shorter person was disadvantaged at birth. The shorter person is given a longer (more expensive) ladder to balance the outcomes.

## Implicit arguments
Equity has several implicit premises.

1. Equal outcomes are more morally positive than unequal outcomes
2. Equal outcomes will improve society as a whole.
3. Merit is not a valid metric in society without considering individual disadvantages

# Argument
I will argue:

- The pursuit of equity is harmful to society
- Equity policies can never be moral, even on an individual basis
