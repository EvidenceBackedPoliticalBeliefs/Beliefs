# Bias
Human brains are full of [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases). There are hundreds of cognitive biases. These are shortcuts in thinking, that have evolved in the mind to reduce the likelihood that someone will die before passing on their genes in a hunter-gatherer world.

While they no doubt represent some local optima for living in that environment, they are wholly unsuitable for making political choices in our current, extremely complex environment.

# Primary biases
I will focus on some important biases here, but many more play a role in decision-making regarding politics.

## Halo effect
In my subjective experience the [Halo Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect) is the most common bias that people fall victim to without even realising it.

The Halo Effect describes how your judgment of someone's actions or opinions changes based on your other judgments about that person.

Imagine a person gives a homeless man £100. Your judgment, in that moment, having no other pre-judgments about the person, may be that they are a good person and that was a moral act.

But then you see that the homeless person is a previous manager you had, who was always very stingy when it came to bonuses at work. Now you look at same act and decide:

- They only gave the money to look good
- Money won't help the homeless man anyway he'll just spend it on drugs

The same act has two interpretations based on your existing judgments. 

### But isn't this just rational prediction based on past experience

While it could be framed this way, it ignores the other possible explanations for the manager's behaviour. This is a subtle way in which we misled, which is that the mind discards alternate theories that do not align with the pre-existing judgments.

What do we know about the manager? We know that they did not give the level of bonuses the employee wanted. Is it possible the bonus policy was set by people above him? 

Could it be that he actually fought really hard to get the meager bonuses he was able to distribute, and the bonuses would have been zero had he not fought?

Could it be that he did have full discretion to choose the bonuses but with the benefit of clearer knowledge about the company's health, decided that it would be better to keep the bonuses low to ensure longer employment for the staff?

It could be that he is simply trying to generate as much profit for the business as possible, because that is what he believes his job role is. But in his personal life he is not bound by such constraints, hence he can be as generous as he wants. 

After all his subordinate employees don't pay his salary or control his ability for promotion.
